    <h1>SCIENCE STREAM AFTER 10TH ---- </h1>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Science Stream: A Brief 
    There are three branches of science: PCM, the non-medical branch, PCB, the medical branch and PCMB. The primary difference between the two streams is the third main subject which is either maths or biology. Alongside the core subjects, the candidates need to learn a first and second language. Alongside these two, PCMB is a common branch of science. Here you get both Mathematics and Biology as the core subjects. 
Let’s discuss the three branches in detail separately. </p>
<p>
 

<h2 style="font-weight:bold"> PCM (Non-Medical)</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold">If you are determined to pursue engineering after high school, the PCM stream is for you. As indicated in the smart art above, Physics, Chemistry, and Maths will be the core subjects alongside language and an optional elective. Here we go with a brief outline for every subject. </p>

 

<h3 style=font-weight:bold>Physics</h3>

<p style="font-weight: bold">As a class eleven student, in the beginning, you will be introduced to some primary concepts on the subject and physics laws. The significant chapters that the syllabus covers include, units of measurements, kinetic energy, motion in a straight line, motion in a plane, thermodynamics, oscillation, waves, gravitation, laws of motion, thermal properties of matter, mechanical properties of fluids and solids, laws of motion. You will be exploring new concepts and find them more interesting as you get ahead. Being serious with studies is vital or you will end up finding the subject boring. </p>

 

<h3 style=font-weight:bold; >Chemistry</h3>

<p style="font-weight: bold">A core subject in the class eleven science stream, Chemistry is often the most feared subject by the candidates. Relax, you need not worry. If you are someone with an urge to learn new concepts on atoms, molecules, chemical equations and willing to do better with every step you are sure to love chemistry! The main chapters will include topics such as basic concepts of chemistry, atom structure, equilibrium, thermodynamics, redox reaction, classification of elements, periodicity properties, hydrogen, e-block and p-block elements, hydrocarbons, organic chemistry, states of matter. You will learn in detail about the world of chemical reactions and get a better understanding of the world around you. </p>

 

<h3 style=font-weight:bold>Maths</h3>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Maths in the eleventh start might be a “hard nut to crack” in the initial stages. But once you get an idea about the complex methods and new structure, boom! You get going smoothly. All you need is thorough concentration to be capable of understanding the concepts. The chapters will comprise the topics like Relations and functions, trigonometric functions, linear inequalities, permutations and combinations, straight lines, conic sections, mathematical induction, quadratic equations, binomial theorem, three-dimensional geometry, limits, and derivatives, probability, statistics, mathematical reasoning. </p>

 
</p>
<h3>List of Optional Subjects </h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold">
Besides studying the core subjects, you will have an elective optional. The electives in PCM are generally among the following: 

 
<p style="font-weight: bold">
Economics: Being a branch of social science, it has two main branches which are microeconomics and macroeconomics. You learn about the economic system of the country, areas of development, infrastructure and get to know about statistical tools. Packed with valuable knowledge, Economics is a wonderful subject to read. 
 
</p><p style="font-weight: bold">
Computer Science: If you are tech-savvy and have a passion for coding, computer science is for you. In the eleventh grade, you will learn about the basics of computer systems, will handle lots of assignments, and gather a fair amount of knowledge in the computer science domain.
 
</p><p style="font-weight: bold">
Home Science: With the aim to upgrade the human environment, home science deals with concepts like child development, family nutrition, communication, resource management, and so on. 
 
</p><p style="font-weight: bold">
Areas of Study after studying PCM in 11th Grade
 
</p><p style="font-weight: bold">
The doors to a wide array of study areas will open once you complete your high school in PCM stream. The table below highlights some significant areas of study you can go for. 
</p><h3>

<h2>2. PCB (Medical)<h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">
If you aspire to be a doctor and do not have a passion for maths, its needless to say PCB is the steam to go for. Other than the main subjects i.e., physics and chemistry, biology is included in the medical stream. If you love to read about living organisms, ways of living, reproduction methods, excretion biology is your cup of tea. Simultaneously, it is significant to be serious with your studies and be consistent.  </p>

<h3 >
Biology:</h3><p style="font-weight: bold">Few candidates have a wrong conception that biology is easy to read in class eleven. No, not! The eleventh-grade syllabus is different from class ten and involves many new concepts and topics. Candidates must prepare themselves confidently to explore a new world. If you are serious and keen to learn, you can make it! The chapters included in eleventh grade are Living world, biological classification, plant and animal kingdom, morphology and anatomy of flowering plants, cells, biomolecules, mineral nutrition, plant respiration, growth and development, gases, body fluids, excretory products, chemical coordination. </p>
