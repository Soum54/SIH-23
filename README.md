- Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is a premier nationwide initiative designed to engage students in solving some of the most pressing challenges faced in everyday life.
- Launched to foster a culture of innovation and practical problem-solving, SIH provides a dynamic platform for students to develop and showcase their creative solutions to real-world problems. By encouraging participants to think critically and innovatively, the hackathon aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application.
